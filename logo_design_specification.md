# SolarBot Logo Design Specification

## Concept
A modern, futuristic logo that represents automated trading on the Solana blockchain with a clean, minimalist aesthetic.

## Design Elements

### Primary Symbol
- A stylized "S" that incorporates:
  - Geometric shapes with sharp angles
  - A subtle reference to the Solana logo (gradient or angle)
  - An abstract representation of trading/arbitrage (perhaps with connecting lines or nodes)

### Typography
- Font: Sans-serif, geometric (recommendations: Montserrat, Poppins, or Gilroy)
- Text: "SolarBot" with "Solar" in medium/bold weight and "Bot" in light weight
- Optional tagline: "Automated Solana Arbitrage" in a smaller, lighter font

### Color Palette
- Primary: Solana Purple (#9945FF)
- Secondary: Solana Green (#14F195)
- Accent: Electric Blue (#00C2FF)
- Background: Deep Space Black (#121212) or Clean White (#FFFFFF)

### Gradient Options
- Option 1: Purple (#9945FF) to Blue (#00C2FF)
- Option 2: Purple (#9945FF) to Green (#14F195)

## Style Guidelines

### Minimalist Version
- Clean lines
- Ample negative space
- Geometric precision
- Monochromatic with a single accent color

### Futuristic Version
- Subtle glow effects
- Gradient transitions
- Thin, precise lines
- Floating or layered elements

## Logo Variations

### Symbol Only
- A standalone mark that works at small sizes (favicon, app icon)
- Clear silhouette that's recognizable even when small

### Horizontal Lockup
- Symbol + "SolarBot" text side by side
- Good for website headers and horizontal spaces

### Vertical Lockup
- Symbol above "SolarBot" text
- Good for profile pictures and square spaces

### Monochrome Version
- Single color version for limited color applications
- Works well in black or white

## Technical Specifications

### File Formats
- Vector: AI, EPS, SVG
- Raster: PNG with transparent background (various sizes)
- Favicon: ICO, 16x16, 32x32, 48x48

### Sizing
- Minimum clear space: Equal to the height of the "S" in SolarBot on all sides
- Minimum size: No smaller than 24px in height for digital applications

## Design Inspiration

### Blockchain/Tech References
- Circuit board patterns
- Node connections
- Data flow visualization
- Blockchain structure

### Trading References
- Subtle chart lines
- Upward trending elements
- Exchange or swap symbols

### Solana Ecosystem
- Incorporate elements that resonate with the Solana design language
- Consider compatibility with the purple/green Solana color scheme

## Application Examples

### Website
- Header logo (horizontal version)
- Favicon (symbol only)
- Loading animation (animated version)

### Social Media
- Profile picture (symbol only or vertical lockup)
- Banner (horizontal version with tagline)

### Marketing Materials

## Additional Notes
- The logo should be simple enough to be recognizable at small sizes
- It should convey technology, automation, and financial sophistication
- The design should feel premium but approachable
- Consider how the logo might animate for digital applications
